# blueprint

A tool that let's you quickly generate blueprint code.

## How
After logging into blueprint, you can create 'blueprints', which essentially
are snippets that allow you to define custom variables. After finishing, you
can generate code by entering all required variables and voil√°: you saved
yourself some time!

Blueprints can be shared publicly, this enables other developers to use the
exact same boilerplate code, encouraging a consistent way of writing code in
your project!

## Setup
* `npm i`
* `npm start`
* `open http://localhost:3000`
